# Algorithms

This repo contains codes for algorithms such as binary search, Fibonnaci Numbers and their properties, Divide & Conquer Algorithms (Quick Sort, MergeSort, etc.), Dat Structures such as Queues, Trees, etc. and Dynamic Programming.

All codes are in Python and the questions are taken from the Algorithmic Toolbox Course on Coursera.
