# Algorithms

This repo contains codes for algorithms such as binary search, Fibonnaci Numbers and their properties, Divide & Conquer Algorithms (Quick Sort, MergeSort, etc.), Data Structures such as Queues, Trees (**DFS** - Preorder, PostOrder, InOder,  **BFS** - LevelOrder), Heaps, Disjoint Sets, Hash Tables etc. and Dynamic Programming.

All codes are in Python and the questions are taken from the Algorithmic Toolbox Course on Coursera. 

A few relatable problems to these topics from Leet Code are also added here, namely - 

  1. Longest Palindromic Substring
  2. Kth Largest element in Array
